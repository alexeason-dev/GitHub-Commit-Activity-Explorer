Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them?
A pivotal decision in this assessment was centered around State Management. I opted not to use Redux but instead employed the Context API, prioritizing a lightweight approach to state management at this stage. For state mutation, I utilized SWR hooks. The design incorporates a well-structured layout, including a sidebar and navbar. While considering a front-end caching mechanism using Redis, I refrained from its implementation due to concerns about potential application heaviness.

How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging")
The assignment consumed approximately 8 hours, distributed as follows:
30 minutes on understanding the framework.
5.5 hours on coding.
2 hours on debugging.



If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?
I would have spent more time on the AI part as in this specific assessment, I stayed occupied with the front-end most of the time. 

Did you learn anything new?
Certainly. I had the opportunity to delve into GitHub APIs, expanding my knowledge in that domain.


Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?
Yes, it did. I effectively demonstrated my proficiency, particularly in problem-solving, the implementation of SWR hooks, the utilization of the Context API, and the efficient handling of state management. If it was not about time constraint then I would have implemented the AI feature in great detail instead of using the third party API.
