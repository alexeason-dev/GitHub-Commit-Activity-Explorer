Which ML-powered feature will you choose and why?
I have selected Sentiment Analysis on the comments of the latest issues as the ML-powered feature. The decision is based on the imperative time constraints. To execute this, I am utilizing GPT-3.5 turbo for efficient sentiment analysis.

What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?
Currently, I don't identify any risks associated with the project. However, I am open to discussing your perspectives on potential risks and addressing any concerns you may have.

What changes/additions would you make to the design?
I propose incorporating a history tab similar to the one in CHATGPT, facilitating the retention of user comparisons over time. Regrettably, I couldn't implement this feature due to its backend requirements, which were beyond the scope of this assessment.

List two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.
In the future, I aim to introduce the history feature, as previously described. Additionally, implementing authentication could enhance the project's functionality and security.

Are there any clarifying questions you would ask? If you're able to make assumptions about these and continue, please record and share your assumptions.
Not applicable.
